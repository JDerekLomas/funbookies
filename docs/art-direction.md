# Funbookies Art Direction Guide

## Brand Philosophy

Funbookies creates decodable books that **look like real picture books**, not educational materials. The art should be so appealing that kids grab these books because they look fun—the phonics scaffolding is invisible.

**Core Principle**: "The simpler the drawing, the more expressive it has to be." — Mo Willems

## Visual Style: "Expressive Minimal"

### The Funbookies Look
A hybrid style combining:
- **Mo Willems' expressiveness**: Characters whose emotions read instantly from across the room
- **Jon Klassen's restraint**: Minimal backgrounds, deadpan moments, visual wit
- **Contemporary digital illustration**: Bold outlines, flat colors, slight texture

### Key Characteristics

| Element | Approach |
|---------|----------|
| **Line work** | Bold black outlines (3-5px weight), confident strokes, slightly imperfect/hand-drawn feel |
| **Color** | Flat fills with minimal shading, saturated but not garish, limited palette per book (5-7 colors) |
| **Shapes** | Simple geometric forms—circles, ovals, rectangles. Characters built from basic shapes |
| **Texture** | Subtle paper grain or noise overlay (10-15% opacity). NOT smooth digital |
| **Backgrounds** | Minimal or solid color. Environment suggested, not detailed |

### What We Avoid
- Realistic rendering or detailed textures
- Busy, cluttered compositions
- Gradients and complex shading
- "Stock illustration" generic style
- Overly cute or saccharine expressions
- Scary or grotesque (even in villains)

## Character Design Principles

### The Funbookies Character Formula

**1. Instant Readability**
- Silhouette test: Character recognizable as solid black shape
- Expression visible at thumbnail size
- One distinguishing feature that appears in EVERY image (Rita's red bow, Rico's blue bandana)

**2. Simple Construction**
```
HEAD: Circle or oval
BODY: Oval or rounded rectangle
LIMBS: Simple tubes or lines
FEATURES: Dots for eyes, simple curve for mouth
```

**3. Expressive Range**
Characters must show emotion through:
- **Eyes**: Size changes (wide = surprise, narrow = suspicion), position, eyebrow angle
- **Mouth**: 5-6 distinct shapes (smile, frown, O of surprise, nervous squiggle, determined line)
- **Body language**: Posture, gesture, lean direction
- **Accessories**: Can react too (bow drooping when sad, bandana flying when running)

### Character Contrast (The Mo Willems Model)

Every Funbookies story features **two characters with opposing energies**:

| Bold Character | Cautious Character |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Initiates action | Questions the plan |
| Eyes wide, leaning forward | One eyebrow raised, leaning back |
| Catchphrase: enthusiastic ("Let's go!") | Catchphrase: hesitant ("But wait!") |
| Warm colors in design | Cool colors in design |
| Round, open shapes | More angular or closed shapes |

This contrast creates **visual comedy** and **relatable dynamics** without words.

## Color Strategy

### Per-Book Palette
Each book has a **signature palette** of 5-7 colors:
- 2 character colors (distinguishing features)
- 1-2 environment colors
- 1-2 accent colors
- White/cream for highlights
- Black for outlines

### Example: Castle Story Palette
```
Rita (warm):     #D4A574 (tan fur), #E53935 (red bow)
Rico (cool):     #8B6914 (brown fur), #1E88E5 (blue bandana)
Environment:     #9E9E9E (castle stone), #7B1FA2 (purple accents)
Antagonist:      #FF8A65 (orange cat)
Goal object:     #C62828 (red jam)
```

### Color Psychology for Early Readers
- **Warm colors** (red, orange, yellow): Energy, excitement, danger
- **Cool colors** (blue, green, purple): Calm, safety, thinking
- **High contrast**: Helps developing visual processing
- **Consistent character colors**: Aids recognition across pages

## Composition & Cinematography

### Shot Types (Film Language for Illustration)

**WIDE SHOT**
- Characters small in frame, environment dominant
- Use for: Establishing location, showing scale, journey moments
- Example: "The castle was big!" — rats tiny at bottom, castle fills frame

**MEDIUM SHOT**
- Characters waist-up or full body, balanced with environment
- Use for: Action, interaction, most story beats
- Example: "Rita saw jam in a dish." — Rita pointing, jam visible

**CLOSE-UP**
- Face fills frame, minimal background
- Use for: Emotions, reactions, catchphrase moments
- Example: "'Let's go!' said Rita." — Rita's excited face, solid background

**DYNAMIC/ACTION SHOT**
- Movement lines, tilted composition, characters mid-motion
- Use for: Chase scenes, physical comedy, climactic moments
- Example: "Dash! Rush! Run!" — blur effects, dust clouds, diagonal composition

### Page Turn Strategy

The **right-hand page** is the reveal. Composition should:
- Lead the eye from left to right
- Place surprises on right side of right-hand pages
- Use left page to build anticipation

**Example sequence:**
- Page 10 (left): Rita bouncing "Jam! Jam! Jam!" — eyes looking right
- Page 11 (right): "But then... a CAT!" — cat emerging from right side

## Humor Strategies

### Dual-Audience Comedy

Funbookies humor works on two levels:

**For Kids (Visual/Physical)**
- Exaggerated expressions (eyes popping, jaw dropping)
- Physical comedy (characters in silly positions)
- Repetition with escalation (bigger, faster, more)
- Food on faces, messy outcomes
- Characters hiding in obvious places

**For Adults (Situational/Subtle)**
- Deadpan reactions to absurd situations
- Character personality contrasts (the worrier paired with the reckless one)
- Knowingness (characters seem aware this is ridiculous)
- Background details that reward attention
- Subverted expectations

### The Jon Klassen Deadpan

Klassen's humor comes from **restraint**:
- Minimal expression changes between panels
- Characters who don't react as expected
- Tension between text and image
- Silence and stillness as punchlines

**Application**: After big action, show characters with flat expressions. The contrast IS the joke.

### Visual Comedy Techniques

1. **Scale contrast**: Tiny characters, huge problems
2. **Repeated visual motif**: Same pose/expression in new context
3. **Background gag**: Something funny happening that text doesn't mention
4. **Knowing look to reader**: Character breaks fourth wall with expression
5. **Exaggeration**: If worried, VERY worried. If happy, ECSTATIC.

- Current expression and body language
- Position in frame (left/right/center)

[ENVIRONMENT]:
- Setting details (minimal but establishing)

- Key objects

[COMPOSITION]:
- Where viewer's eye should go
- Relationship between elements

[STYLE REMINDER]:

```

### Example Prompt Template

```
MEDIUM SHOT: [Brief scene description]

LEFT: [Character A] ([physical description], [distinguishing feature])
[action/pose], expression is [specific emotion] - [detailed expression
description: eyes, mouth, body language].

RIGHT: [Character B] ([physical description], [distinguishing feature])

## Consistency Requirements

### Character Consistency Checklist

For EVERY image of a character, verify:
- [ ] Correct fur/skin color (use hex codes)
- [ ] Distinguishing feature present and visible (bow, bandana, etc.)
- [ ] Correct body proportions (same height ratio between characters)
- [ ] Eyes match style (same size, same highlight placement)
- [ ] Expression matches story moment

### State Tracking

Track character states across pages:
- **Physical state**: Clean → dirty → clean again (jam on face)
- **Emotional arc**: Content → excited → scared → relieved → satisfied
- **Accessories**: Intact → disheveled → restored

Include state reminders in prompts: "Rita (jam still on face from previous scene)"

## Appendix: Style References

### Primary Influences
