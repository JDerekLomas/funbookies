# Reading Pedagogy Framework for Funbookies
## Phonics Progression, Word Lists, and Scaffolding Strategies

---

## Part 1: The Phonics Scope & Sequence

Children learn to read in a predictable progression. Your books should align with where kids ARE in this journey.

### The Standard Progression

| Level | Skills | Example Words | Grade |
|-------|--------|---------------|-------|
| **1. Short Vowels (CVC)** | Consonant-Vowel-Consonant | cat, run, hot, big, pet | K-1 |
| **2. Consonant Digraphs** | Two letters → one sound | sh, ch, th, ck, wh | K-1 |
| **3. Blends** | Consonant clusters (each keeps sound) | bl, cr, st, mp, nd | K-1 |
| **4. CVCC / CCVC** | Blends in CVC words | jump, stop, spin, clap | 1 |
| **5. Magic E (CVCe)** | Silent e makes vowel long | cake, bike, rope, cute | 1 |
| **6. Open Syllables** | Syllable ends in vowel | me, go, no, hi, we | 1 |
| **7. Vowel Teams** | Two vowels → one sound | ee, ea, ai, oa, ow | 1-2 |
| **8. R-Controlled Vowels** | Vowel + r changes sound | ar, er, ir, or, ur | 1-2 |
| **9. Diphthongs** | Vowel sounds that glide | oi/oy, ou/ow | 2 |
| **10. Multisyllabic** | Multiple syllables | picnic, sunset, rabbit | 2+ |

### What This Means for Funbookies

**Your current books (ages 6-7) should focus primarily on Levels 1-5:**
- CVC words: the foundation
- Digraphs: sh, ch, th (common in kids' vocabulary)
- Blends: helps with action words (run, stop, jump)
- Magic e: opens up vocabulary significantly

## Part 3: Sight Words / Heart Words

### The Distinction That Matters

| Type | Definition | Teaching Approach |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| **Flash Words** | High-frequency BUT decodable | Practice until automatic |
| **Heart Words** | High-frequency with irregular parts | Decode what you can, memorize the "heart" |

### Heart Words: Teach the Tricky Part

**Example: "said"**
- /s/ = decodable ✓
- /ai/ = tricky (sounds like /e/) ❤️
- /d/ = decodable ✓

Mark or circle the "heart" (irregular) part. Kids decode what they can, memorize only what they must.

### Essential Sight Words for Early Readers (Dolch Pre-Primer + Primer)

**Pre-Primer (40 words)** - These should appear in ALL your books:
```
a, and, away, big, blue, can, come, down, find, for,
funny, go, help, here, I, in, is, it, jump, little,
look, make, me, my, not, one, play, red, run, said,
see, the, three, to, two, up, we, where, yellow, you
```

**Primer (52 words)** - Add these progressively:
```
all, am, are, at, ate, be, black, brown, but, came,
did, do, eat, four, get, good, have, he, into, like,
must, new, no, now, on, our, out, please, pretty, ran,
ride, saw, say, she, so, soon, that, there, they, this,
too, under, want, was, well, went, what, white, who, will,
with, yes
```

### Flash Words vs Heart Words in the Dolch Lists

**Fully Decodable (Flash Words)**:
can, run, big, get, in, it, at, on, up, not, but, did, had, him, his, hot, if, just, let, red, sat, ten, yet, went...

**Partially Irregular (Heart Words)** - mark the tricky part:
- **said** (ai sounds like e)
- **the** (th says /ð/, e is schwa)
- **was** (a sounds like short o)
- **have** (a is short, not magic e)
- **come** (o sounds like short u)
- **some** (o sounds like short u)
- **do** (o sounds like long u)
- **to** (o sounds like long u)
- **you** (ou sounds like long u)
- **they** (ey sounds like long a)
- **there** (ere sounds like air)
- **where** (ere sounds like air)
- **what** (a sounds like short o)

## Part 4: Repetition Strategy

### Research Finding
The quantity of targeted reading practice matters more than whether the same text is re-read. However, repetition WITHIN texts (same phonics patterns, same words) builds automaticity.

### Repetition Within Your Books

**1. Target Word Repetition**
Pick 5-8 key decodable words per story. Use each word 3-5 times throughout.

Example for volcano story:
- "hot" appears on pages 6, 13, and in word list
- "run" appears on pages 10, 11, and word list
- "pop" appears on pages 9 and word list

**2. Pattern Repetition**
Repeat similar sentence structures:
```
"Run, Gus, run!" → "Run, run, run!"
"Hot! Hot! Hot!"
"Jam! Jam! Jam!"
```

**3. Sound Pattern Repetition**
Group words with same phonics pattern:
- -op words: pop, hop, top, stop
- -un words: run, fun, sun, bun
- -at words: cat, sat, rat, hat

**4. Refrain Repetition**
A repeating phrase throughout the story (Pete the Cat style):
```
Every few pages: "But did Gus cry? No! He ran!"
Or: "Hop, hop, HOP!" (catchphrase)
```

## Part 5: Picture Support Strategy

### The Science

Pictures provide scaffolding but shouldn't enable guessing:
- **DO**: Show context, setting, emotion, action
- **DON'T**: Show text literally (if text says "cat," don't NEED the picture to decode it)

### Picture Functions in Decodable Books

| Function | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Context** | Where is the action happening? | Castle interior, jungle canopy |
| **Emotion** | How does the character feel? | Scared face, happy smile |
| **Action Support** | What's happening? | Character running, jumping |
| **Vocabulary Support** | Visual for new/topic words | What does "crater" look like? |
| **NO Decode Support** | Don't show decodable words literally | If "cat" is decodable, picture supports story but isn't required to read "cat" |

### Best Practice for Your Books

1. **Illustrations should EXTEND, not REPLACE text**
   - Text: "Gus saw a big hole"
   - Picture: Shows Gus's expression of wonder, the scale of the crater, steam rising
   - NOT: Just a hole labeled "hole"

2. **Support emotional comprehension**
   - Kids may not understand "scared" as a word
   - Picture shows scared body language, wide eyes
   - Research: "Children respond to visual representation of emotions before verbal phrases"

3. **Keep illustrations SIMPLE**
   - Research finding: "Streamlining book illustrations improves attention and comprehension in beginning readers"
   - Avoid cluttered backgrounds
   - Focus attention on key story elements
   - Your current flat cartoon style is pedagogically sound!

## Part 6: Word List Design

### Current Approach (Good Foundation)

Your word lists have three categories:
- Sound-out words (decodable)
- Sight words (high-frequency)
- New/topic words

### Enhanced Structure

```json
{
  "word_list": {
    "decodable": {
      "cvc": ["hot", "run", "big", "got", "top"],
      "blends": ["drip"],
      "digraphs": ["hiss"]
    },
    "sight_words": {
      "flash": ["the", "to", "up", "it", "a"],
      "heart": ["said", "was", "I"]
    },
    "vocabulary": {
      "topic": ["lava", "magma", "crater"],
      "character": ["Gus"]
    }
  },
  "phonics_focus": ["short vowels CVC", "-ss ending"],
  "target_level": "Level 1-2"
}
```

### Word List Presentation for Parents/Teachers

**Sound It Out!** (point to letters as you blend)
| Word | Sounds | Blend |
|------|--------|-------|
| hot | /h/ /o/ /t/ | hot |
| run | /r/ /u/ /n/ | run |
| big | /b/ /i/ /g/ | big |

**Know By Heart** (tricky parts underlined)
| Word | Tricky Part | Say |
|------|-------------|-----|
| said | ai = /e/ | sed |
| was | a = /o/ | wuz |

**New Words** (pictures help!)
| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| lava | Hot melted rock that flows |
| crater | Big hole at top of volcano |

## Part 7: Keeping Simple Text Engaging

### The Challenge
You have ~5-8 words per page, mostly CVC. How do you make that NOT boring?

### Techniques That Work

**1. Onomatopoeia (Sound Words)**
```
POP! HISS! CRACK!
SPLAT! ZOOM! CRASH!
```
- Exciting
- Often phonetically regular
- Kids love saying them

**2. Exclamations**
```
"Wow!" said Gus.
"Oh no!"
"Yes! Yes! Yes!"
```

**3. Repetition with Variation**
```
Run, Gus, run!
Run up the hill!
Run, run, RUN!
```

**4. Questions (Creates Anticipation)**
```
Can Gus get out?
Will Rita find the jam?
```

**5. Rhythm and Rhyme (When Natural)**
```
The cat sat.
The cat sat on a mat.
The cat sat on a hat!
```

**6. Dramatic Pauses (Ellipsis)**
```
But then...
A cat!
```

**7. Physical/Action Words**
```
Jump! Run! Hop! Stop!
Dig! Grab! Spin! Win!
```
(Note: Action words are often CVC or simple blends)

**8. Character Voice**
```
"I can do it!" said Gus.
```
Give characters things to SAY, not just do.

**9. Contrast and Surprise**
```
Small rat. BIG castle!
Slow sloth. Fast bird!
```

**10. Genuine Stakes (Not Just Physical)**
```
"I want jam," said Rita.
"But what about the cat?"
Can they get the jam AND stay safe?
```

## Part 8: Book Leveling System

### Proposed Funbookies Levels

| Level | Phonics Focus | Word Count/Page | Target Age |
|-------|---------------|-----------------|------------|
| **Yellow** | CVC only | 3-5 words | Early K |
| **Orange** | CVC + digraphs | 5-7 words | K-1 |
| **Red** | + blends | 6-8 words | 1st |
| **Purple** | + magic e | 8-10 words | 1st-2nd |
| **Blue** | + vowel teams | 10-15 words | 2nd |

### Your Current Books = Orange/Red Level

Volcano, Castle, Jungle stories use:
- Primarily CVC words
- Some digraphs (hiss, crack)
- Some blends (drip)
- ~5-8 words per page
- Age 6-7 appropriate
